Ghost hunters use a variety of techniques and tools to investigate alleged paranormal activity.[25][26] While there is no universal acceptance among ghost hunters of the following methodologies, a number of these are commonly used by ghost hunting groups.[27]

<LI>Still photography and video: using digital, night vision, infrared, and even disposable cameras.
<LI>EMF meter: to detect possibly unexplained fluctuations in electromagnetic fields.
<LI>Tablet PC: to record data, audio, video and even environmental fluctuations such as electromagnetic fields.[27]
<LI>Ambient temperature measurement: using thermographic cameras, thermal imaging cameras, infrared thermometers, and other infrared temperature sensors. It should be noted that all of these methods only measure surface temperature and not ambient temperature.[28]
