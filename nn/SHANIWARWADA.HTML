Known for its sheer architectural brilliance, this fort has witnessed various spooky occurrences. It is believed that the level of supernatural activity is on its zenith on every full moon night. The mysterious story behind the strange activities suggests that a young prince was brutally murdered here which is maybe why his spirit haunts the place and when the night falls, sounds of him shrieking can be heard. There are many locals who actually camp at night on the fort grounds just to hear the little boy’s scream.
It is preferable to visit the fort during day hours since the fort is deserted at night except for maybe a caretaker. Visit this place at your own risk as this would definitely be the scariest haunted place in Pune, India.</FONT></B>
