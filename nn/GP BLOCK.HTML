GP Block in Meerut is also very notoriously known for all the paranormal activity it beholds. Despite being a popular zone, there have been reportedly a lot of strange sightings.
For instance people who pass this place claim to have seen four males sitting together and enjoying an alcoholic beverage by the light of a single candle. At first, this was not considered spooky for it could just be four friends having a good time but once it was established that it was indeed four ghosts, people in and around the area became increasingly interested. In addition, some claim to also witness a young girl coming out of the house in what many people believe to be a red dress. With time people have abandoned that place for obvious reasons but it continues to catch the fancy of those who love the paranormal.</FONT></B>
