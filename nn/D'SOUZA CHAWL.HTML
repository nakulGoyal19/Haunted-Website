A Chawl is a building up to 4-5 floors. D'Souza Chawl in Mumbai, Mahim (near Canossa primary school) has a well inside its compound. The well was not having a boundary around it. One woman while getting water from that well the soil around the well collapsed in too well with the lady and she died. It is repeated many times people saw the apparition of the unfortunate lady wanders around the well at late night and disappears before the dawn. "The lady of the well" did not harm anyone but though people are advised not to go towards the wall at night.</FONT></B>
