The ghost town of Bhangarh is one of the scariest, spookiest places you could possibly imagine, not to mention, one of the most haunted places in India. Situated near a popular forest, this town is now slowly luring visitors from around the area, and country, for all the wrong reasons.
It should be noted that if you decide to visit this place after the sun has gone down, you won’t be allowed to. In fact, there is a strict warning about how dangerous this place becomes after sunset.
The story which this town is well-known for tells the tale of a magician who fell in love with the local princess of the area even though their match was impossible. Being quite the master of dark magic, he decided to cast a spell on her to make her surrender to him. However, the princess learned of his plans and found a way to kill him. Before his death, however, the magician cast a dark spell on the palace which caused its doom.
Despite Bhangarh Fort being regarded as one of the most horror haunted places in India has been officially promoted as a tourist destination. However, once the night falls and the darkness takes over, this place becomes deserted, leaving it prey to the supposed ‘supernatural’. The mystery of Bhangarh Fort also featured on a TV show and you can have a look at the most haunted place in India’s video yourself. </FONT></B>
