Situated along the Arabian Sea in Gujarat, this beach is known for its black sand and mystical activities.
Many unexplainable and puzzling incidents have been known to occur like strange whispers being heard, people disappearing during night etc.
In fact, it is believed that a lot of people have lost their lives exploring this mysterious beauty.
If you are a brave heart, you can test the waters yourself by taking a midnight stroll along the beach, if you have company. If the testimonies are anything to go by, you will also be greeted by warnings asking you to not cross a certain line while on the beach. It is also believed that this beach was for long used as a Hindu burial ground, therefore, being the resting place of tortured souls. There have also been reports of people disappearing mysteriously and having never been found again. However, if you still feel you would want to go for it then by all means. If you love the paranormal you would definitely have the time of your life.</FONT></B>
