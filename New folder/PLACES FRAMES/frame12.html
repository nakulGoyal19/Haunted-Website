<H1>Story Behind The GP Block, Meerut, UP</H1>

<p>Meerut is an ancient city in Uttar Pradesh, which according to the Hindu mythology,<br>
was once ruled by Maya or Mayasura (Mayasura was an ancient king of Daitya or Asura or Rakshasa clan,<br>
and was renowned for his architectural abilities. It is believed that Mayasura and his subjects even<br>
had the ability to melt stones and boulders for construction of magnificent architectures.<br>
Mayasura ruled over MayaRastra (currently called Meerut in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India).<br>
According to Uttar-Kand in Ramayana, Mayasura was the son of Diti and Rishi Kashyapa.<br>
He was the father of Mandodari (Ravana's wife). Hence, Meerut is also known as 'Ravan Ki Sasural'<br>
literally meaning 'home of Ravana's wife'. It is believed that Mandodari used to worship Goddess<br>
Chandi in an old Chandi Devi temple in the compound of Nauchandi ground.<br>
Meerut is one of the fastest developing cities in India. The infrastructure of Meerut is currently<br> 
going through a boom with many upcoming projects consisting of lots a new buildings, shopping complexes,<br> 
malls, roads, flyovers, residential apartments. In the hubbub of the city, there is a gray shade provided<br>
to the city by an area called GP Block, which is renowned for being one of the most haunted locations<br>
in the city.
The GP Block is haunted by the ghosts of four men who are often sighted in a double storey building,<br>
which has been abandoned for years. The guys sit around a table in the with a solitary lighted candle,<br>
enjoying, and drinking beer. Sightings of a lady clad in red dress departing the building has often<br>
been reported. The sightings keeps on reiterating again and again all over the building commencing<br>
from the first floor, to second floor, and then ceasing at the terrace.
Mystery shrouds behind the ghostly appearances till date. The two storey building has been locked for<br>
many years, and people even can't remember who used to live here, and when. However, due to predominant<br>
ghostly sightings, and paranormal activity, people normally try to avoid traveling through the road<br>
around the haunted building.
The GP Block in Meerut is considered haunted and is placed at 9th position in the list of ten most<br>
haunted places in India.
