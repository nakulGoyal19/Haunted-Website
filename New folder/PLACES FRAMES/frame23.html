<H1>Story Behind the SHANIWARWADA</H1>

<p>SHANIWARWADA is a historical fortification in the city of Pune in Maharashtra, India. Built in 1732,[1] it<br> 
was the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818, when the Peshwas lost control to the British East<br>
 India Company after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the<br>
 center of Indian politics in the 18th century.[2]
The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained<br>
 as a tourist site.
The Shaniwar Wada was originally the seven storied capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed<br>
 to be made entirely of stone but after the completion of the base floor or the first story, the people of Satara <br>
(the national capital) complained to the Shahu(King) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the Shahu(King)<br>
himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to<br>
 be made of brick and not stone. The Wada was then completed and upon being attacked by the British Artillery 90 years later,<br>
 all the top six stories collapsed leaving only the stone base, which was immune to the British artillery. Hence only the stone<br>
 base of the Shaniwar Wada remains and can be seen even today in the older parts of Pune.<br>
By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort.
In 1773, Narayanrao, who was the fifth and ruling Peshwa then, was murdered by guards on orders of his uncle Raghunathrao <br>
and aunt Anandibai. A popular rumour says that Narayanrao's ghost still calls for help on full moon nights. Various people,<br>
 working around the area, have allegedly reported such cries.[3][4] Sound of"Kaka mala wachawa"(Uncle save me) by Narayanrao <br>
Peshawe after his death.
In June 1818, the Peshwa, Bajirao II, abdicated his Gaddi (throne) to Sir John Malcolm of the British East India Company and<br>
 went into political exile at Bithoor, near Kanpur in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India.
On February 27, 1828, a great fire started inside the palace complex. The conflagration raged for seven days. Only the heavy <br>
granite ramparts, strong teak gateways and deep foundations and ruins of the buildings within the fort survived.[5]
According to Haricharitramrutsagar, a biographical text of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, He had visited Shaniwarwada on the insistence <br>
of Bajirao II in 1799.<br>
Peshwa Baji Rao I, prime minister to Chattrapati Shahu, laid the ceremonial foundation of his own residence on Saturday, January<br>
 10, 1730. It was named Shaniwarwada from the Marathi words Shaniwar (Saturday) and Wada (a general term for any residence complex).<br>
 Teak was imported from the jungles of Junnar, stone was brought from the nearby quarries of Chinchwad, and Lime (mineral) <br>
was brought from the lime-belts of Jejuri. Shaniwarwada was completed in 1732, at a total cost of Rs. 16,110, a very large sum at the time.<br>
The opening ceremony was performed according to Hindu religious customs, on January 22, 1732, another Saturday chosen for being<br> 
a particularly auspicious day.
