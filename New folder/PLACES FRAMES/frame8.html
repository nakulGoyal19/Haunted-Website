<H1>Story Behind the D’SOUZA CHAWL</H1>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL BLACK" SIZE="5"> D’Souza Chawl is located near Canossa Primary School in Mahim, Mumbai. <BR>
The Chawl has a well from which the people used to fill in water and wash clothes.<BR>
The well was quite dangerous as it did not have any boundary walls around it. One day,<BR>
while filling water a woman fell in the well as the whole structure around the well collapsed.<BR>
The lady struggled for quite a time and then died a painful death.
After this unpleasant incident, the locals, especially the residents of the Chawl believe that<BR>
the lady is seen every night near the well. Many people have spotted the apparition of a lady, <BR>
speculated to be the ghost of the unfortunate woman, in the vicinity of the well during the nights.<BR>
This has been reported multiple times.<BR>
She appears near the well every night, wanders around, and then eventually disappears by the dawn. <BR>
Even though the apparition is believed to be harmless, the residents of the Chawl are advised to keep at<BR>
bay from the well especially during the nights.</FONT>
