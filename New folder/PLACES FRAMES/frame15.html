<H1>Story Behind the KULDHARA</H1>

<p>KULDHARA is an abandoned village in the Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan, India.<br>
 Established around 13th century, it was once a prosperous village inhabited by Paliwal Brahmins.<br>
 It was abandoned by the early 19th century for unknown reasons, possibly because of dwindling water<br>
 supply, or as a local legend claims, because of persecution by the Jaisalmer State's minister Salim Singh.<br>
 A 2017 study suggests that Kuldhara and other neighbouring villages were abandoned because of an earthquake.<br>
Over years, Kuldhara acquired reputation as a haunted site, and the Government of Rajasthan decided to develop <br>
it as a tourist spot in the 2010s.
The Kuldhara village was originally settled by Brahmins who had migrated from Pali to Jaisalmer region.[2] These<br>
 migrants originating from Pali were called Paliwals. Tawarikh-i-Jaisalmer, an 1899 history book written by Lakshmi Chand,<br>
 states that a Paliwal Brahmin named Kadhan was the first person to settle in the Kuldhara village. He excavated<br>
 a pond called Udhansar in the village.[1]
The ruins of the village include 3 cremation grounds, with several devalis (memorial stones or cenotaphs).[3]<br>
 The village was settled by the early 13th century, as indicated by two devali inscriptions. These inscriptions are <br>
dated in the Bhattik Samvat (a calendar era starting in 623 CE), and record the deaths of two residents in 1235 CE and 1238 CE respectively.[4]<br>
