Are you the kind of person who will not even Google<b><font color="orange"> 'ghost'</font></b>if you are at home alone? Or the one to get your intestines in knots if you hear the kitchen tap dripping in the middle of the night? Or the kind to suspect paranormal intervention every time your box of cigarettes goes missing?<u><b><font color="orange"><br>Then for the sake of your night's sleep, we will suggest you not to proceed ahead.</font></b></u><br>

But if you are the kind who freaked friends out as a kid by insisting you play 'planchette' and talk to dead people, <b><font color="orange"><u>congratulations, you're on the right page.</u></font></b><br>

Now according to a small minority of people , <font color="orange"><u>ghosts and spirits are not fictional things. </u></font><u>They insist -- much like you'd want to believe -- that there's actually creatures beyond the understanding of humans, living among them.</u>
And these people actually try to establish communication with these 'ghosts' or 'spirits'. <br><font color="orange">We would  strongly advise you against laughing off the idea of 'bhoot pret'.</font><br>
In our site you would find  everything related to ghosts and  spirits. <br><br><br>
