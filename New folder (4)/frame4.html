<H1>Story Behind the Haunted Fort Bhangarh</H2>

<p>Located at the border of the Sariska Tiger Reserve in the Alwar district of Rajasthan,<br>Bhangarh Fort is a 17th century fort, 
infamous all over India for being the “Most haunted<br> place in India“. 
Because of the numerous ghostly experiences and happenings in the fort premises,<br> 
villages have sprung up far away from the fort, due to the fear of what lies within.<br> 
Even the Archaeological Survey of India or the ASI has forbidden the locals and tourists from entering the fort at night.<br> 
This completely ruined, haunted fort of Bhangarh does have a very eerie, negative aura to it.<br> 
Several legends have attested to the paranormal happenings inside the fort.<br>
There are always two sides of the story of the Bhangarh Fort, haunted for generations.<br>
Let me relate the story first. The two sides can wait for some time.<br>
A group of tourists once bribed the keeper of a fort to let them inside the complex of the supposedly haunted Bhangarh Fort<br>
(a notoriously infamous one at that) once night fell. The keeper let them in, albeit with a stern warning that<br>
it wasn’t advisable to go inside the fort since it was believed to be haunted by spirits during the night.<br> 
Unmindful of the warning, the group trotted inside joking and laughing. It was all good up to the point they noticed<br> 
a boy sitting alone inside one of the rooms. The only anomaly was that the room had no door and a window which was<br> 
tightly grilled to make sure that no one could enter in or venture out. What happened next is an occurrence I need not describe.<br> 
I believe my readers are clever enough to guess the inevitable.</p>
